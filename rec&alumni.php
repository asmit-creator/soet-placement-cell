		<h4><u>Alumni</u></h4>
			<p>An organizationâ€™s alumni are the reflection of its past, representation of its present and a link to its future. An engaged alumni network allows the university to benefit from the skills and experience of the students who have successfully graduated, by offering their support to the present students, to the institution and to each other. Leveraging the alumni community often proves beneficial for both the institution and the alumni as they willingly reconnect with their alma-matter as a sign of their gratitude and affinity towards the institution.
			Our treasured alumni contribute in varied ways, as such by sharing their competency and experience, serving as a role model, which enhances our prospects as our alumni reflect our identity by playing the role of global emissary.<br><br>
